# Introduction

ROS or Robot Operating System is a meta-operating system used to operate robots or robotic hardware. A meta-operating system can be understood as an abstraction layer over an existing operating system and in that it provides us with a framework to test and design our robot.
It has a range of supported programming languages namely, C++ and Python and is a popular among the open source community. As such, there are a wide range of packages and codes that are available to us to choose from as well as extensive documentation on its operation. Utilising the freely available in-built and additional packages, ROS can give finer control of the robot without writing all control methods from scratch.


# Objectives
The purpose of this project is to familiarize with ROS. Using unique packages pre-built by developers of ROS, we perform multiple actions of movement, localization, map building and then autonomous navigation. We will break down the process and discuss them in details in the further sections.
